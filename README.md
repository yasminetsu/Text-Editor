# Text-Editor
An application that allows the user to write notes to a saved browser or downloaded application. The notes will stay saved until deleted by the user.

## Motivation
There is no question of the convenience of having an app that gives you the ability to take, track, and keep notes on your personal device. Whether it is a grocery store list, things you need to get done at work, a cool quote you heard and don't want to forget, or a couple of ideas you happen to have while out and about, a note taking app will aid you in all of your ventures and ensure all of that stuff rambling around in your head has a tangible place to be stored at your convenience.
